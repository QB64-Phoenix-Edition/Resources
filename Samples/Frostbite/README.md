# Frostbite Tribute
A clone of Frostbite for the Atari 2600, which was originally designed by Steve Cartwright and published by Activision in 1983.

Written in QB64.

From the game manual:

> The object of the game is to help Frosbite Bailey build igloos by jumping on floating blocks of ice. Be careful to avoid these deadly hazards: killer clams, snowgeese, Alaskan king crab, grizzly polar bears and the rapidly dropping temperature.

You'l need QB64 to compile the game: www.qb64.org

If you don't want to compile it, download the latest beta already compiled in the repo (Windows and macOS versions for now).

All sound files are embedded into the source code (and consequently in the final binary) and will be unpacked when it's run.
