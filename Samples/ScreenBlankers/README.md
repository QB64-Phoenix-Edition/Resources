# Some simple Screen blankers written in QB64
Most of the screen blanker modules in this small collection are written by myself, others were just graphic sample programs from other QB64 Forum members, which I've altered into a blanker module. Just read the header notes in each module for credits and more information.

**Blanker modules:**

- Fractal
- Lightning
- Mystify
- Spinner
- Splines
- Worms
- and several more
