Opening sequence:

Mr. Perry's opening sequence uses PC squeaker sound and primitive graphics.
I wanted to retain his vision of having an opening sequence to the game. I
updated the music to utilize MIDI and drew the number four using checkers
in a much different way utilizing much improved graphics offered by QB64.

Sprites vs Qbasic:

For checkers I utilized sprite images versus Mr. Perry's original Qbasic
graphics statements such as CIRCLE and PAINT. This allowed me to have
premade enhanced 3D checkers utilized in the game.

Gameplay:

I stuck with Mr. Perry's version by allowing the player to choose which
column to drop a checker in by moving an icon across the top of the
playing board. I replaced Mr. Perry's down arrow icon however with a 3D
rendered spinning checker.

Sound:

Realistic sounds were replaced for the checker drop utilizing WAV files,
once again replacing Qbasic's PC squeaker SOUND command.

AI:

Mr. Perry's AI utilized an external file for mapping and AI decision
making purposes. I decided to replace the AI with a MIN/MAX algorithm for
computer decision making.
