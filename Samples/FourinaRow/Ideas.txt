The main inspiration for the MIN/MAX with Alpha/Beta pruning algorithm used
in the game came from Keith Pomakis' Connect-4 Algorithm Version 3.11 found

The reason I chose the game Four in a Row was becuase of a program and
article I wrote in 1992 for a game called Link Four which can be viewed

My original Link Four used a very, very crude form of AI that in my opinion
was about as good as a beginner to intermediate player. It was my hope that
by utilizing the work done by Philip Perry (Qbasic version of Four in a
Row) and Keith Pomakis (Connect-4 MIN/MAX algorithm) I could create a much
smarter modern version of Four in a Row utilizing QB64's strengths.
