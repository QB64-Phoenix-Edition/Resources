# Important Note by Steve:  

These files were taken from https://github.com/a740g/QB64-Museum and added here, as a place to highlight them and make them easy for the public to find and reference.  a470g is still updating his orignial site and adding new samples there all the time, so what you find here will probably not represent the whole works of what he has archived.  This folder was last updated and had its contents synced to his site's on Jan 23, 2023, to give anyone who browses and finds themselves here a clear idea of how out-of-date the contents of this folder may be.

# What are these?

These are [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) ([GWBASIC](https://winworldpc.com/product/gw-basic/3x), [QBasic](https://winworldpc.com/product/qbasic/1x), [QuickBASIC](https://winworldpc.com/product/quickbasic/45), [Microsoft BASIC PDS](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-basic/pds-71), [Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0 for DOS](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/10-for-dos), [QB64](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64)) programs tested and fixed for [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe).

1. Some of the `unknowns` are placeholders and I will update with the correct information once I find them
2. Some of these are mildly or significantly modified to work with QB64-PE and may no longer work with anything else
3. Some of these are unmodified as they were written for QB64-PE and are here just as part of the collection
4. If you want the original versions, then folllow the links below or search on the internet
5. I will keep updating this repo with new stuff that I can find and fix to work with QB64-PE
6. Help me by contributing, fixing or just filling the `unknowns`. Pull requests welcome!
